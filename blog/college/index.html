Almost everyone can agree that college has become unreasonably expensive, but the agreement ends there. Some see students as victims who are getting robbed by extortionate tuition, while others feel that students going into debt for degrees with poor employment prospects are dupes who have only themselves to blame. Underlying all of this is a profound confusion about the ultimate function of higher education.</p>
<p>A basic way to understand college is as a place where a student can gain skills needed to work in certain kinds of jobs. As long as the lifetime wage premium for jobs requiring a college education exceeds the cost to attend a college, going to college makes economic sense, even if it means graduating with debt. It still seems prudent for society as a whole to encourage people to gain these specialized work skills by subsidizing the upfront cost of college, as would be the case under Warren's plan.</p>
<p>However, when I was studying for my bachelor's degree at Carleton College, I and many other students were studying in academic fields in the humanities and social sciences that seemed to explicitly eschew teaching knowledge that could apply to a particular job. This happens at liberal arts colleges as well as schools of Arts and Sciences at public universities around the country. </p>
<p>Is there a purpose to college for humanities and social science majors? Many people would say no. However, defenders of the liberal arts claim that a liberal arts education develops thinking and communication skills that are useful in a wide variety of jobs. While this argument is broadly true, it also seems backwards. If studying the humanities imparts those valuable work skills, that is clearly just a desirable side effect rather than the main aim. Surely there are more direct and efficient ways to teach students logic, reading, and writing for a workplace setting than to have them write papers on Aristotle's views on friendship. The liberal arts are only worth studying if the knowledge gained is valuable in itself. </p>
<p>I believe that the study of the liberal arts is beneficial. I believe the goal of this study should be for a student to develop a sense of history and culture, which can happen through close study of the classics, art history, literature, philosophy, and modern social research. The focus should be on understanding how we got to where we are today, which means understanding the history of ideas in the Western world that created our liberal democratic society. This is the kind of education that can give people a moderate political temperament, as well as the confidence to earnestly and tenatiously defend our liberal freedoms and advocate for effective ways to improve our society. As such, I see the liberal arts as primarily having a political goal of supporting stable democracy. (These are ideas I take mainly from Allan Bloom's famous work, <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>, which I recommend that everyone read.)</p>
<p>The trouble, of course, is that while these political benefits help society, they don't materially benefit an individual, so why would someone pay $50,000 a year to receive a liberal arts education? I believe public higher education in all its forms should be provided at a much lower cost, and that if we don't, then liberal arts education may wither away, with worrisome political implications. However, the reality is that the liberal arts live on, for now, because it is interesting enough to study for a certain kind of unfocused, intellectual young person, who very often doesn't have to worry too much about the cost of college due to their financial circumstances. Then, as a little economic bonus for these liberal arts majors, our society's white collar job market discriminates in favor of people with a bachelor's degree, not because the jobs require a particular skill that is taught in college (they generally don't), but because the people doing the hiring are usually college graduates who have every interest in believing that a college degree prepares someone to do a job that should really be open to all regardless of education. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/11/20/surprise-humanities-degrees-provide-great-return-on-investment/#517752252031">The data seems to show that the financial benefit from this favoritism is on average greater than the cost of college tuition</a>, so a liberal arts degree still makes financial sense for most people. And this is what maintains the rather unsatisfying status quo for college today.</p>
<p>Because colleges seem to be confused as to the point of their existence, they are totally confused on the question of who should get admitted to college. In most countries, universities with selective admissions admit  solely based on test scores. These universities understand their purpose to be to produce the best scholars, and therefore admit those whom they (accurately or not) determine to be the most academically able students. American colleges and universities seem reluctant to relinquish their power to shape the student body to a standardized test. The consideration of a student's character in admission has its origins in a successful <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in">1920s effort by the Ivy League to exclude Jews</a>, who were academically outperforming Protestant students to an unacceptable extent. Recently, Harvard University has been accused of using largely the same system to exclude Asian applicants. Elite colleges everywhere claim that they aim not to admit the most academically talented students, but to create a "balanced class" with a diversity of perspectives. I can't help but note that my class at Carleton College would have had a far greater diversity of perspectives had they not chosen to admit primarily students with high test scores and grades. So clearly, it is admitting the most academically qualified students, and not ensuring a diversity of perspectives, that is the main admissions goal for colleges, but they build themselves a lot of wiggle room for other priorities. </p>
<p>It seems that there is a legitimate debate to be had about athletic and race-based admissions. However, can we all at least agree that preferencial admission for legacies and relations of donors is corrupt and wrong? At Harvard, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/04/663629750/legacy-admissions-offer-an-advantage-and-not-just-at-schools-like-harvard">legacy students enjoyed a 34 percent acceptance rate compared to 5.9 percent for non-legacies</a>. A large donation to a college can "buy" a college admission. This is not some weird conspiracy theory—President Rosenberg of Macalester College confirms that <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Only-Surprise-in-the/245882">"Virtually everyone who works in the world of college admissions or fund raising knows this to be true."</a> Let's call out this practice for what it is: a de facto preference for wealthy white students. This is extremely off-putting and makes a mockery of the egalitarian image that these colleges like to project in their admissions brochures. Some may argue that these preferences secure the funds necessary for colleges to educate less fortunate students. I find this argument unconvincing. Yes, we know that the practice benefits colleges financially—they wouldn't bother with it otherwise. A college's mission is not so noble that it justifies corruption. Furthermore, MIT manages to be both extremely wealthy while officially eschewing legacy preferences (their stance on admissions for the relations of large donors is unclear). Recently, I have been getting many communications from Carleton asking me to make a donation. During my time at Carleton, I received heavy tuition assistance, and I know that my education cost more to provide than what my family and I paid to receive it (as it did for all students, even those paying full tuition). I also recognize that in our country, colleges act both as ladders to opportunity as well as gatekeepers from it, and given this, I find legacy preferences in admissions to be absolutely un-American, so I don't feel inclined to give financial support to any college with such a preference, even to a college I personally benefited from. <a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/ira/assets/Carleton_CDS_2018_2019_Final_Copy.pdf">Carleton lists alumni/ae relation as being an "Important" factor in admission</a>. If Carleton feels that they need a legacy preference to keep their big alumni donors happy, then they should raise their money from them, not from a small fry like me. </p></div></div><div id="footer-container"></div></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.page={"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-blog-entry-js","jsonName":"blog-college-54c","path":"/blog/college"};window.dataPath="263/path---blog-college-54-c-da5-ujAaEvmw5T2Uc8FPivwYSWibcc";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-508eec55d36bec65759b.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-entry-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-entry-js-3c446fafbc066c82dc7a.js"],"component---src-templates-generic-page-js":["/component---src-templates-generic-page-js-2be77d9f85aa013d7070.js"],"component---src-pages-404-js":["/component---src-pages-404-js-f3bd13919cb2e76d36bf.js"],"component---src-pages-blog-js":["/component---src-pages-blog-js-d7f2c6a8bd0d04b13a0f.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-5cb97b7350e345273b7d.js"],"pages-manifest":["/pages-manifest-aa598865a35e159bdfc1.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/webpack-runtime-1ca8f1faecf66e9c02ee.js" async=""></script><script src="/styles-f4f16d99b0a2000f52f9.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-508eec55d36bec65759b.js" async=""></script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-entry-js-3c446fafbc066c82dc7a.js" async=""></script><script src="/1-9e8a0066bb08e9b04b70.js" async=""></script></body></html>
