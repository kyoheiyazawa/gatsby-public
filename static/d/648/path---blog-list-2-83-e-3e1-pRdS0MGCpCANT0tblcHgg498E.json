The discourse around the movie has generally been negative, so I went in with low expectations, but I surprised myself by having a great time! Justice Smith plays the charming main character Tim, a mild mannered insurance adjuster with a repressed love of Pokémon who goes on an adventure to find his dad. Through <em>Rashomon</em>-like twists and turns, Tim must wade through conflicting accounts of a car crash that is tied to his dad's disappearance. This was an exciting storyline with a lot of heart, and it's nice that Tim searches for his dad given that the original Pokémon Game Boy games have you start your adventure by leaving your mom.</p>\n<p>Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu is the more controversial aspect of this movie, although I think for most people the choice of Ryan Reynolds is less outrageous than the fact that Pikachu talks at all. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/broderick/status/930126330615730182\">viral clip of Pikachu briefly speaking English</a> in <em>Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!</em> is still a fresh trauma. Although I was laughing along with the rest of the internet when the <em>Detective Pikachu</em> trailers first came out, after having seen the movie I think that Ryan Reynolds did a good job playing Pikachu in a goofy but sincere way. The other potentially weird thing about this movie is that it has CGI Pokémon that are seamlessly integrated into live action. It was initially shocking to see Pikachu covered in realistic yellow fur in the <em>Detective Pikachu</em> trailer. There is something unsettling about encountering a beloved cartoon character in the flesh. (Artist <a href=\"https://miguel_vasquez.artstation.com/\">Miguel Vazquez</a> has played with this idea by creating some terrifying realistic renditions of characters from <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Hey Arnold</em>, and other cartoons.) So the creators of <em>Detective Pikachu</em> had to strike a fine balance of not making the Pokémon look <em>too</em> realistic, while also not making them look video gamey and fake. I think they mostly got it right, with a few exceptions (among them a scary looking Charizard with weirdly textured skin). The visuals throughout the movie are gorgeous. Ryme City, the setting of the movie, is futuristic and colorful as a Pokémon city should be, but it also feels like a place where real people live and work. It was believable and really cool to see Pokémon inhabiting a live action world just as if they were normal animals. Throughout the movie, Tim wears a leather jacket—but did the leather come from a dead cow or a Tauros? These and other \"are Pokémon animals\" questions sadly remain unanswered in <em>Detective Pikachu</em>. </p>\n<p>In 1996, <em>Pocket Monster Red</em> and <em>Pocket Monster Green</em> were released in Japan for the Nintendo Game Boy. In the following few years, Pokémon became a trading card game, then a TV show, then a worldwide cultural phenomenon. It occurs to me that I am part of a unique generation of people that entered childhood just as Pokémon was coming into existence. When I was growing up, Pokémon was described as a \"craze,\" I think with the expectation that it would soon self-combust and fade away, just like a sugar rush. Today, 23 years later, Pokémon's earliest fans such as myself aren't so young anymore, but Pokémon is still new and exciting—not just confined to the 90s nostalgia bin. Pokémon has had incredible cultural staying power over the years, perhaps only exceeded by that of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. In recent years, Pokémon has birthed the versatile \"Surprised Pikachu\" meme, ruined smartphone batteries around the world with <em>Pokémon Go</em>, and even served as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o95KxKKrgkQ\">poetic inspiration for a Republican Presidential candidate</a>. On another note, I actually ended up seeing <em>Detective Pikachu</em> a second time with a group spanning ages 8 to 28, and we all had a blast, which I think speaks to the incredible power of Pokémon to speak to kids, or the former kids within us. The movie made me want to dig out my old Game Boy and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> cartridge, but I also can't wait to see what new Pokémon thing comes out next.</p>","excerpt":"I recently saw  Pokémon Detective Pikachu  in theaters.

Almost everyone can agree that college has become unreasonably expensive, but the agreement ends there. Some see students as victims who are getting robbed by extortionate tuition, while others feel that students going into debt for degrees with poor employment prospects are dupes who have only themselves to blame. Underlying all of this is a profound confusion about the ultimate function of higher education.</p>\n<p>A basic way to understand college is as a place where a student can gain skills needed to work in certain kinds of jobs. As long as the lifetime wage premium for jobs requiring a college education exceeds the cost to attend a college, going to college makes economic sense, even if it means graduating with debt. It still seems prudent for society as a whole to encourage people to gain these specialized work skills by subsidizing the upfront cost of college, as would be the case under Warren's plan.</p>\n<p>However, when I was studying for my bachelor's degree at Carleton College, I and many other students were studying in academic fields in the humanities and social sciences that seemed to explicitly eschew teaching knowledge that could apply to a particular job. This happens at liberal arts colleges as well as schools of Arts and Sciences at public universities around the country. </p>\n<p>Is there a purpose to college for humanities and social science majors? Many people would say no. However, defenders of the liberal arts claim that a liberal arts education develops thinking and communication skills that are useful in a wide variety of jobs. While this argument is broadly true, it also seems backwards. If studying the humanities imparts those valuable work skills, that is clearly just a desirable side effect rather than the main aim. Surely there are more direct and efficient ways to teach students logic, reading, and writing for a workplace setting than to have them write papers on Aristotle's views on friendship. The liberal arts are only worth studying if the knowledge gained is valuable in itself. </p>\n<p>I believe that the study of the liberal arts is beneficial. I believe the goal of this study should be for a student to develop a sense of history and culture, which can happen through close study of the classics, art history, literature, philosophy, and modern social research. The focus should be on understanding how we got to where we are today, which means understanding the history of ideas in the Western world that created our liberal democratic society. This is the kind of education that can give people a moderate political temperament, as well as the confidence to earnestly and tenatiously defend our liberal freedoms and advocate for effective ways to improve our society. As such, I see the liberal arts as primarily having a political goal of supporting stable democracy. (These are ideas I take mainly from Allan Bloom's famous work, <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>, which I recommend that everyone read.)</p>\n<p>The trouble, of course, is that while these political benefits help society, they don't materially benefit an individual, so why would someone pay $50,000 a year to receive a liberal arts education? I believe public higher education in all its forms should be provided at a much lower cost, and that if we don't, then liberal arts education may wither away, with worrisome political implications. However, the reality is that the liberal arts live on, for now, because it is interesting enough to study for a certain kind of unfocused, intellectual young person, who very often doesn't have to worry too much about the cost of college due to their financial circumstances. Then, as a little economic bonus for these liberal arts majors, our society's white collar job market discriminates in favor of people with a bachelor's degree, not because the jobs require a particular skill that is taught in college (they generally don't), but because the people doing the hiring are usually college graduates who have every interest in believing that a college degree prepares someone to do a job that should really be open to all regardless of education. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/11/20/surprise-humanities-degrees-provide-great-return-on-investment/#517752252031\">The data seems to show that the financial benefit from this favoritism is on average greater than the cost of college tuition</a>, so a liberal arts degree still makes financial sense for most people. And this is what maintains the rather unsatisfying status quo for college today.</p>\n<p>Because colleges seem to be confused as to the point of their existence, they are totally confused on the question of who should get admitted to college. In most countries, universities with selective admissions admit  solely based on test scores. These universities understand their purpose to be to produce the best scholars, and therefore admit those whom they (accurately or not) determine to be the most academically able students. American colleges and universities seem reluctant to relinquish their power to shape the student body to a standardized test. The consideration of a student's character in admission has its origins in a successful <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in\">1920s effort by the Ivy League to exclude Jews</a>, who were academically outperforming Protestant students to an unacceptable extent. Recently, Harvard University has been accused of using largely the same system to exclude Asian applicants. Elite colleges everywhere claim that they aim not to admit the most academically talented students, but to create a \"balanced class\" with a diversity of perspectives. I can't help but note that my class at Carleton College would have had a far greater diversity of perspectives had they not chosen to admit primarily students with high test scores and grades. So clearly, it is admitting the most academically qualified students, and not ensuring a diversity of perspectives, that is the main admissions goal for colleges, but they build themselves a lot of wiggle room for other priorities. </p>\n<p>It seems that there is a legitimate debate to be had about athletic and race-based admissions. However, can we all at least agree that preferencial admission for legacies and relations of donors is corrupt and wrong? At Harvard, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/04/663629750/legacy-admissions-offer-an-advantage-and-not-just-at-schools-like-harvard\">legacy students enjoyed a 34 percent acceptance rate compared to 5.9 percent for non-legacies</a>. A large donation to a college can \"buy\" a college admission. This is not some weird conspiracy theory—President Rosenberg of Macalester College confirms that <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Only-Surprise-in-the/245882\">\"Virtually everyone who works in the world of college admissions or fund raising knows this to be true.\"</a> Let's call out this practice for what it is: a de facto preference for wealthy white students. This is extremely off-putting and makes a mockery of the egalitarian image that these colleges like to project in their admissions brochures. Some may argue that these preferences secure the funds necessary for colleges to educate less fortunate students. I find this argument unconvincing. Yes, we know that the practice benefits colleges financially—they wouldn't bother with it otherwise. A college's mission is not so noble that it justifies corruption. Furthermore, MIT manages to be both extremely wealthy while officially eschewing legacy preferences (their stance on admissions for the relations of large donors is unclear). Recently, I have been getting many communications from Carleton asking me to make a donation. During my time at Carleton, I received heavy tuition assistance, and I know that my education cost more to provide than what my family and I paid to receive it (as it did for all students, even those paying full tuition). I also recognize that in our country, colleges act both as ladders to opportunity as well as gatekeepers from it, and given this, I find legacy preferences in admissions to be absolutely un-American, so I don't feel inclined to give financial support to any college with such a preference, even to a college I personally benefited from. <a href=\"https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/ira/assets/Carleton_CDS_2018_2019_Final_Copy.pdf\">Carleton lists alumni/ae relation as being an \"Important\" factor in admission</a>. If Carleton feels that they need a legacy preference to keep their big alumni donors happy, then they should raise their money from them, not from a small fry like me. </p>","excerpt":"Elizabeth Warren's proposed plan  to cancel student loan debt and eliminate tuition at public universities has pushed higher education back into the national conversation.

However, I recently finished his memoir <em>On Writing</em>, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in writing as a craft. In the book, King briefly recounts his life and career and lets you peek under the hood of his hit factory. King is full of unpretentious and solid writing advice that is sure to benefit anyone who takes writing seriously.  </p>\n<p>But aside from the writing advice, this disarmingly honest passage from the book piqued my interest:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides, if you really did write a stinker—it happens; as the author of <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> I'm qualified to say so...  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this is some of that King magic in action—this passage had me dying to learn more about his worst work. In <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>, Stephen King is more <em>auteur</em> than author. <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> is a movie based on the Stephen King short story \"Trucks,\" and it is also the first and only movie directed by King. Stephen King makes a cameo appearance in the film as a man who becomes enraged when a rogue ATM display tells him that he is \"an asshole,\" and he even appears in the movie's trailer, which you can watch below:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggWS4tTzs60\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>  \n<p>My favorite part of the trailer is when Stephen King points at the camera with crazed-looking eyes and says, \"I'm going to scare the hell out of you!\" This is a refreshing change from modern trailers that show too much and ruin the plot and the best jokes of a movie, so more directors should do this. According to Wikipedia and multiple YouTube commenters, King was in a cocaine-addled state for much of this movie's production, so that could explain his strange appearance in the trailer.  </p>\n<p>As you can tell from the trailer, <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> has a fabulous soundtrack that is a mix of 80's synth sounds and the music of AC/DC, which was a brilliant directorial choice. AC/DC's obnoxious anthems are the ideal match for the atmosphere of this strange movie.  </p>\n<p>The setup of the movie is that humanity comes under attack when some sort of supernatural comet casts its dark influence upon Earth, causing all machines to become sentient and murderous. Our main characters seek refuge in a rural truck stop as 18-wheelers circle around them. Stepping outside means certain death accompanied by a weird alarm sound that plays whenever a truck kills someone.  </p>\n<p>I can understand Stephen King referring to this movie as a \"stinker,\" because it is undeniably bad. I did end up watching the whole movie, but I do have to agree with the assertion that \"the trailer was scarier than the movie lol\" by YouTube commenter BigKnGa. The acting is mediocre to bad all around, and the story is fairly boring at times due to a lack of action. The worst of these lulls is when the humans are forced to spend hours refueling an endless caravan of 18-wheelers queued up at the truck stop while \"Hells Bells\" by AC/DC plays in the background.  </p>\n<p>A more fundamental problem with this movie is that trucks are simply not that scary on screen. Trucks are mundane looking, rather plain objects. Mechanical villains being unscary is a problem in other films as well, such as the 2004 <em>I, Robot</em> starring Will Smith. We humans still react most viscerally to our animal fear of a threatening pair of eyes, and sharp, glistening teeth and claws. Though the trailer shows Stephen King standing in front of a truck with a horrifying devil face on the front (please, give whoever designed this prop an award!), I was disappointed to learn that the face is not the result of a supernatural transformation, but is simply a plastic display ornament placed on the truck by its owner before the start of the truck rebellion. After watching the trailer, I was expecting a dark Thomas the Tank Engine sort of thing where all of the trucks sprout horrible faces. Perhaps this was not possible due to budget or the production possibilities of the time. With advancements in CGI technology, I have great hopes for a remake of this film directed by a now sober Stephen King, starring trucks transformed by dark cosmic magic into horrifying giant beasts with jaws dripping with malice and motor oil that devour any human in their path. </p>","excerpt":"I have never actually read a Stephen King novel, though I have watched and enjoyed many movies based off of his stories such as  Carrie ,  It , and  Gerald's Game .

Released in 2004, it delivered chart-smashing success for Green Day against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and its overarching theme — the Iraq War. Though the album is full of strong singles such as \"Holiday\" and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\" the entire album is tied together by a rock opera concept in the same vein as the Who's <em>Tommy</em>. <em>American Idiot</em> tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a troubled, unremarkable teen from a generic American suburb.  </p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> was the hottest shit when it came out while I was in middle school. Everyone went nuts about it and the songs were all over the radio. The black Parental Advisory label on the CD cover prevented some kids from obtaining the CD but strengthened its anti-authoritarian message. We resented Tipper Gore's legacy while wishing her husband were the president instead of the Doonesbury asterisk who sat in the White House. The album is packed full of catchy songs, and I can still play all of the songs from the album on guitar — an easy accomplishment since the entire album is power chords over meat and potatoes sort of progressions. While a lot of good music was produced in this era, <em>American Idiot</em> more than any other album of this time confronted head-on the alienation I and my peers felt at suburban monoculture and American chauvinism close to home, and the criminal acts of an isolated America abroad. I grew up in the environs of Boulder, a blue enclave within red Colorado. I imagine people who grew up elsewhere experienced this era quite differently. Thinking back on it now, I think that the Bush II era is when the fraying apart of American society really began in earnest. <em>American Idiot</em> is for me (and I suspect many others of my generation) the definitive soundtrack to this important time period in our lives and American history.  </p>\n<p>Here are my top 3 tracks from <em>American Idiot</em>, ranked.  </p>\n<h3>3. Give Me Novacaine</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1-YMsOUE2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>  \n</iframe>\n</div>\n<p>The intro has a sweeter melody compared to the rest of the songs on the album and a slide guitar sound lends it a slightly loopy feel. The song's theme of sedation works well with the contrast in sound between this part and the aggressive electric guitar-backed verses, which are classic Green Day. Stabbing the V chord at the end of the chorus to build tension is stereotypical Green Day as well.</p>\n<h3>2. Boulevard of Broken Dreams</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Soa3gO7tL-c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>The incredibly iconic intro of \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" is probably my second favorite usage of guitar tremolo (my favorite is in the epic outro of the song \"Black Sabbath\" on the album <em>Black Sabbath</em> by the band Black Sabbath). Note that Green Day repeat their trick of ending the chorus by hammering on the V chord in this song — why mess with a winning formula?  </p>\n<h3>1. Jesus of Suburbia</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNKPYhXmzoE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\"Jesus of Suburbia\" seems be the song where Green Day tried their hardest to realize their rock opera concept for <em>American Idiot</em>. The song transitions seamlessly between five movements, each with a completely different sound and character. It is nine minutes long and not boring for a single second. Near the end of the last \"Tales of Another Broken Home\" movement there is a lovely \"movement within a movement\" that is one of my favorite parts of the song but always throws me off when I play this song on guitar.\n</p>","excerpt":"American Idiot  is one of the most popular albums by Green Day.
