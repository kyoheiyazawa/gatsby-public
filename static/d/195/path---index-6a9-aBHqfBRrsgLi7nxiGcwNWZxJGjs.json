Released in 2004, it delivered chart-smashing success for Green Day against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and its overarching theme — the Iraq War. Though the album is full of strong singles such as \"Holiday\" and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\" the entire album is tied together by a rock opera concept in the same vein as the Who's <em>Tommy</em>. <em>American Idiot</em> tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a troubled, unremarkable teen from a generic American suburb.  </p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> was the hottest shit when it came out while I was in middle school. The black Parental Advisory label on the CD cover prevented some kids from obtaining the CD but made its anti-authoritarianism come across stronger — we all resented Tipper Gore's legacy while wishing her husband were the president instead of the Doonesbury asterisk who sat in the White House. The album is packed full of catchy songs, and I can still play all of the songs from the album on guitar — an easy accomplishment since the entire album is power chords over meat and potatoes sort of progressions. While a lot of good music was produced in this era, <em>American Idiot</em> more than any other album of this time confronted head-on the alienation I and my peers felt at suburban monoculture and American chauvinism close to home, and the criminal acts of an isolated America abroad. I grew up in the environs of Boulder, a blue enclave within red Colorado at the time. I imagine people who grew up elsewhere experienced this era quite differently. Thinking back on it now, I think that the Bush era is when the fraying apart of American society really began in earnest. <em>American Idiot</em> is my generation's definitive soundtrack to this important time period in our lives and American society.  </p>\n<p>Here are my top 3 tracks from <em>American Idiot</em>, ranked.  </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1-YMsOUE2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>  \n</iframe>  \n    \n### Give Me Novacaine  \nsdsfsdfsdf","excerpt":"American Idiot  is Green Day's seventh studio album.

The internet is riddled with burnt out shells of neglected personal blogs that sport an outdated default WordPress theme and were last updated during a snowstorm in January 2016. Much blogging has moved to commercial platforms such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium.com</a>, but another thing that happened is that the idea of personal blogging itself seems rather quaint now — a relic of the old web. As the internet has exploded in commercial value, the character of the web has become commercial as well. Brochure aesthetic has taken over web design. Everywhere you click, the web in 2019 is corporate, and while this isn't a bad thing in some respects, there is something profoundly boring about it.</p>\n<p>I created my new blog site with a feeling of nostalgia for what the web used to be — a wild frontier for freedom in ideas, and a diverse, grungy gathering place for weirdos, hucksters, and scholars. A place where you could let your mind escape your unremarkable physical surroundings to aimlessly wander the world.  </p>\n<p>I wanted to keep a sparseness evocative of the old web for my site design. In the past, sites were plain due to bandwidth and technological constraints, but today we can take a look back and appreciate the focus on content brought by this simplicity. The design is somewhat inspired by <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/\">Salon.com</a>, which I think is one of the most distinctive looking news sites. Salon, of course, was web-only from its inception, and it has this look that is totally self-confident about being a web publication, which I love. Websites that put on a posh air and in doing so nakedly crave the prestige of print publications are deserving of scorn. I feel like Medium was the initiator of this trend although I can't be sure. The worst offender in recent memory is <a href=\"https://quillette.com/\">Quillete.com</a>, which is basically a parody of this phenomenon. The font choice hugely influences the impression given off by a website. Sans-serif is the look of the populist web. I chose Roboto as my main text font, mainly because I like how it looks on Salon. It gives a good, slightly unusual look to long text.   </p>\n<p>As for the technology, I am using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> to generate a static site. It was interesting to learn about Gatsby, which is extremely cool and trendy right now, but the idea of having a static site with no backend is rather old school. Gatsby makes updating a static site with new content as quick as using a WordPress-like CMS. The advantage of a static site is that I can host it for free on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> (thanks, GitHub!), it's very quick to load, and seems safer in terms of security. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this setup for someone without web development experience, as Gatsby in particular had a pretty steep learning curve. Something like WordPress probably remains the easiest way to spin up a personal blog.</p>\n<p>I've made many failed attempts in the past to get myself to write regularly, but I'm hoping I have learned from my past experiences, and being a liberal, I believe that my nature can be overcome through structure. My downfall in the past has been that I would plan large blog posts about complicated topics, and then never feel inclined to finish them. On my new blog, I hope to write relatively short posts about simple topics like movies I watch, or books I read, and to do so frequently. I would like my main reason for blogging to be to improve my writing, so I'm not too concerned if no one ends up reading what I write here, although feedback is always nice and appreciated. Writing for web needs to be percussive and lively, and I know that I have a problem with having an overly heavy style. For this site I want to work on writing in a terse, clean voice, and clean up some of the sloppy habits that I have developed. I do want to stick to general interest topics and avoid the deluge of rambling personal anecdotes that are an unfortunate hallmark of the blogosphere (a tweet I saw recently about how looking up a recipe for soup online obliges you to read someone's life story before you can learn how to make the soup comes to mind). I want to make a real effort to get good quality writing out there, but I'll try not to take myself too seriously in the process. </p>","excerpt":"The blogosphere has been in a rather sad state as of late.

Theranos was a medical startup that promised to make veinous blood draws obsolete by running a variety of blood tests via a prick of the finger. The company had ambitions to place a Theranos device in every home in America. People would be able to prick their finger and place a drop of blood in their Theranos device, and receive their blood test results right away, all within the confines of their living room.  </p>\n<p>However, Theranos never even came close to solving the engineering challenges required to make this dream a reality. This is a predictable conclusion in retrospect. Theranos's core idea of making blood testing devices use less blood is fairly obvious and must have occurred to the established multinational medical device manufacturers as well - why would the upstart Theranos succeed where they had failed?  </p>\n<p>Theranos didn't let reality stand in the way of its march towards success. Theranos promised capabilities it did not have to enter partnerships with large chains such as Safeway and Walgreens to place Theranos testing centers in their retail locations. Engineers working at Theranos who were bullied into working late nights and weekends did make some progress, but the product they created was nothing more than a prototype, and often gave wildly inaccurate results for many blood tests. Rather than hit the brakes at this point as any responsible company would, Theranos decided to proceed with testing real patients' blood with cavalier disregard for their health and safety.  </p>\n<p>Theranos's trajectory was tightly bound with the personality of its founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes. Bad Blood is as much about Holmes the person as it is about Theranos the company. Holmes dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos. She deftly leveraged family and Stanford connections to open doors for Theranos and assemble a star-studded board of directors (among them Henry Kissinger and James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis). The media couldn't resist Holmes's story of a college dropout upending a staid industry, and a young woman succeeding in the male-dominated startup world. Many observers linked Holmes's larger than life personality with her memorable physical traits such as her deep voice and her hypnotically large eyes (incidentally, one of the sources interviewed in Bad Blood claims Holmes's deep voice is fake and deliberately cultivated). Also interesting is the role of Sunny Balwani, a Theranos executive who was feared by employees and was romantically involved with Holmes, unknown to the board. Any Theranos employees who expressed misgivings about the company's morally questionable actions faced Balwani's wrath. Theranos's celebrity backers made the company appear to be manifestly legitimate, while Holmes and Balwani carried out what was essentially a scam, gobbling up investor funds and corporate contracts while producing nothing but misleading promises and bogus test results.  </p>\n<p>Carreyrou sticks to the facts in his meticulous and no-nonsense telling of the Theranos story, which leaves the reader with more questions than answers. Theranos could not have gotten as far as it did without the support of its famous advocates, its large corporate partners, and fawning media coverage. How is it possible that all of these respectable people were taken in by Holmes and Balwani's chicanery? How could Holmes be clever enough to gain and betray the trust of America's most prominent public figures while at the same time carrying on a charade that was not only a danger to patients but was also clearly unsustainable? Carreyrou doesn't presume to know the answer to these questions. The reader is simply left with a sense of incredulity.   </p>\n<p>Theranos began to unravel after Carreyrou published a long form exposé in the Wall Street Journal. The latter part of Bad Blood deals with Carreyrou's battle with Theranos's desparate attempts to kill the story. This part of the book especially is a page-turner. Seeing the fraud of Theranos unmasked in the end is a triumph for justice in this quintessentially American saga. </p>","excerpt":"Bad Blood is the story of the rise and fall of Theranos.
