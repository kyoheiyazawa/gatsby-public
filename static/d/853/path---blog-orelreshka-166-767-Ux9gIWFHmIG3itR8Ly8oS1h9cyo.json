{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>When I was planning a trip to London and Paris last year, I didn't turn to Rick Steves or Lonely Planet for guidance. Instead, I took to YouTube to watch my favorite travel show, <em>Heads and Tails</em>. <em>Heads and Tails</em> (Орёл и Решка) is a Russian-language TV show produced by a Ukranian company. I found this show while looking for fun ways to keep up with Russian. Luckily for us Americans, the production company of <em>Heads and Tails</em> posts full episodes of this show on YouTube. It's unclear to me how this show is profitable when it is available for free online, especially considering its expensive episode format.</p>\n<p>Each episode of <em>Heads and Tails</em> is presented by two hosts, and begins at the airport. The London episode shows the two hosts who have just arrived at Heathrow Airport and are ready to start their weekend vacation in London. One of them is wearing a backpack, and the other is holding the <em>Heads and Tails</em> golden credit card. One of the hosts greets their new destination with a \"<em>Privet</em>, London!\" and flicks a £1 coin into the air. The coin toss decides which of the hosts gets the golden card for the weekend, while the other host is left with the backpack. The host with the golden credit card can spend an unlimited amount of money with the card, while the other host must backpack through the weekend, living off a single $100 bill. After much rejoicing from the bearer of the golden card and grumbling from the backpacker, the two hosts part ways. The backpacker gets gouged by the airport money changer to exchange their $100 for local currency, and then heads to the city on public transit, while the golden host gets picked up at the airport in an ostentacious sports car, ready to live like a millonaire for the weekend. At the end of each episode, the hosts prepare a bottle with $100 tucked inside and hide it in a secluded location, and show you directions on how to find the treasure.  </p>\n<p>This is a super fun format for a travel show, and I'm surprised something similar doesn't exist on English language TV. Having been the backpacker with the $100 bill myself, I am impressed with how accurately <em>Heads and Tails</em> captures the unpredictable feel of budget travel within a slickly produced TV show, and while I'm sure various preparations are happening off camera, the show feels very real and authentic to me. In some locations, $100 is actually a substantial amount of money in relation to the average local wage, and the host can live quite comfortably for the weekend. In some expensive cities, living on $100 is a real challenge, but even in those situations the hosts always do a great job of showcasing fun free things to do in a city. On the other hand, the host with the golden card can show a side of a destination that most of us will never get to experience, which is fun in its own way. Around the megacities of the world, the golden card provides access to jaw dropping hotel rooms and gastronomic experiences of questionable value. In less touristic destinations, the hosts splash out for experiences that seem more outrageous than luxurious.</p>\n<p>Each season revolves around a particular theme. My favorite was Season 7's \"Back in the USSR,\" in which my favorite <em>Heads and Tails</em> hosts, Andrey Bednyakov and Nastya Korotkaya, visit fascinating locations around the former Soviet Union, from the dapper Baltic states, to places off the tourist radar in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Russian Far East, to sprawling Moscow, where they finish the season.</p>\n<p><em>Heads and Tails</em> to me is a reminder of how big humanity is. There are so many places with a unique language, customs, cuisine, and architecture, and in each of these places you find the rich and poor living their separate lives. The world is deserving of wonder and it's important for me to be reminded of this sometimes. </p>","excerpt":"When I was planning a trip to London and Paris last year, I didn't turn to Rick Steves or Lonely Planet for guidance.
