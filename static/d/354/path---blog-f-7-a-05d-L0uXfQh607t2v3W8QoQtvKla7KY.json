However, I recently finished his memoir <em>On Writing</em>, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in writing as a craft. In the book, King briefly recounts his life and career and lets you peek under the hood of his hit factory. King is full of unpretentious and solid writing advice that is sure to benefit anyone who takes writing seriously.  </p>\n<p>But aside from the writing advice, this disarmingly honest passage from the book piqued my interest:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Besides, if you really did write a stinker—it happens; as the author of <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> I'm qualified to say so...  </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this is some of that King magic in action—this passage had me dying to learn more about his worst work. In <em>Maximum Overdrive</em>, Stephen King is more <em>auteur</em> than author. <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> is a movie based on the Stephen King short story \"Trucks,\" and it is also the first and only movie directed by King. Stephen King makes a cameo appearance in the film as a man who becomes enraged when a rogue ATM display tells him that he is \"an asshole,\" and he even appears in the movie's trailer, which you can watch below:</p>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggWS4tTzs60\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>  \n<p>My favorite part of the trailer is when Stephen King points at the camera with crazed-looking eyes and says, \"I'm going to scare the hell out of you!\" This is a refreshing change from modern trailers that show too much and ruin the plot and the best jokes of a movie, so more directors should do this. According to Wikipedia and multiple YouTube commenters, King was in a cocaine-addled state for much of this movie's production, so that could explain his strange appearance in the trailer.  </p>\n<p>As you can tell from the trailer, <em>Maximum Overdrive</em> has a fabulous soundtrack that is a mix of 80's synth sounds and the music of AC/DC, which was a brilliant directorial choice. AC/DC's obnoxious anthems are the ideal match for the atmosphere of this strange movie.  </p>\n<p>The setup of the movie is that humanity comes under attack when some sort of supernatural comet casts its dark influence upon Earth, causing all machines to become sentient and murderous. Our main characters seek refuge in a rural truck stop as 18-wheelers circle around them. Stepping outside means certain death accompanied by a weird alarm sound that plays whenever a truck kills someone.  </p>\n<p>I can understand Stephen King referring to this movie as a \"stinker,\" because it is unmistakably bad. I did end up watching the whole movie, but I do have to agree with the assertion that \"the trailer was scarier than the movie lol\" by YouTube commenter BigKnGa. The acting is mediocre to bad all around, and the story is fairly boring at times due to a lack of action. The worst of these lulls is when the humans are forced to spend hours refueling an endless caravan of 18-wheelers queued up at the truck stop while \"Hells Bells\" by AC/DC plays in the background.  </p>\n<p>A more fundamental problem with this movie is that trucks are simply not that scary on screen. Trucks are mundane looking, rather plain objects. Mechanical villans being unscary is a problem in other films as well, such as the 2004 <em>I, Robot</em> starring Will Smith. We humans still react most viscerally to our animal fear of a threatening pair of eyes, and sharp, glistening teeth and claws. Though the trailer shows Stephen King standing in front of a truck with a horrifying devil face on the front (please, give whoever designed this prop an award!), I was disappointed to learn that the face is simply a display ornament legitimately placed on the truck by its owner before the start of the truck rebellion. After watching the trailer, I was expecting a dark Thomas the Tank Engine sort of thing where all of the trucks sprout horrible faces, but this was not the case. Perhaps they were limited by budget or the possibilities of the time. With advancements in CGI technology, I have great hopes for a remake of this film directed by a now sober Stephen King, starring trucks transformed by dark cosmic magic into horrifying giant beasts with jaws dripping with malice and motor oil that devour any human in their path. </p>","excerpt":"I have never actually read a Stephen King novel, though I have watched and enjoyed many movies based off of his stories such as  Carrie ,  It , and  Gerald's Game .

Released in 2004, it delivered chart-smashing success for Green Day against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and its overarching theme — the Iraq War. Though the album is full of strong singles such as \"Holiday\" and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\" the entire album is tied together by a rock opera concept in the same vein as the Who's <em>Tommy</em>. <em>American Idiot</em> tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a troubled, unremarkable teen from a generic American suburb.  </p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> was the hottest shit when it came out while I was in middle school. Everyone went nuts about it and the songs were all over the radio. The black Parental Advisory label on the CD cover prevented some kids from obtaining the CD but strengthened its anti-authoritarian message. We resented Tipper Gore's legacy while wishing her husband were the president instead of the Doonesbury asterisk who sat in the White House. The album is packed full of catchy songs, and I can still play all of the songs from the album on guitar — an easy accomplishment since the entire album is power chords over meat and potatoes sort of progressions. While a lot of good music was produced in this era, <em>American Idiot</em> more than any other album of this time confronted head-on the alienation I and my peers felt at suburban monoculture and American chauvinism close to home, and the criminal acts of an isolated America abroad. I grew up in the environs of Boulder, a blue enclave within red Colorado. I imagine people who grew up elsewhere experienced this era quite differently. Thinking back on it now, I think that the Bush II era is when the fraying apart of American society really began in earnest. <em>American Idiot</em> is for me (and I suspect many others of my generation) the definitive soundtrack to this important time period in our lives and American history.  </p>\n<p>Here are my top 3 tracks from <em>American Idiot</em>, ranked.  </p>\n<h3>3. Give Me Novacaine</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1-YMsOUE2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>  \n</iframe>\n</div>\n<p>The intro has a sweeter melody compared to the rest of the songs on the album and a slide guitar sound lends it a slightly loopy feel. The song's theme of sedation works well with the contrast in sound between this part and the aggressive electric guitar-backed verses, which are classic Green Day. Stabbing the V chord at the end of the chorus to build tension is stereotypical Green Day as well.</p>\n<h3>2. Boulevard of Broken Dreams</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Soa3gO7tL-c\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>The incredibly iconic intro of \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" is probably my second favorite usage of guitar tremolo (my favorite is in the epic outro of the song \"Black Sabbath\" on the album <em>Black Sabbath</em> by the band Black Sabbath). Note that Green Day repeat their trick of ending the chorus by hammering on the V chord in this song — why mess with a winning formula?  </p>\n<h3>1. Jesus of Suburbia</h3>\n<div class=\"embed-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNKPYhXmzoE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<p>\"Jesus of Suburbia\" seems be the song where Green Day tried their hardest to realize their rock opera concept for <em>American Idiot</em>. The song transitions seamlessly between five movements, each with a completely different sound and character. It is nine minutes long and not boring for a single second. Near the end of the last \"Tales of Another Broken Home\" movement there is a lovely \"movement within a movement\" that is one of my favorite parts of the song but always throws me off when I play this song on guitar.\n</p>","excerpt":"American Idiot  is one of the most popular albums by Green Day.

The internet is riddled with burnt out shells of neglected personal blogs that sport an outdated default WordPress theme and were last updated during a snowstorm in January 2016. Much blogging has moved to commercial platforms such as <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium.com</a>, but another thing that happened is that the idea of personal blogging itself seems rather quaint now — a relic of the old web. As the internet has exploded in commercial value, the character of the web has become commercial as well. Brochure aesthetic has taken over web design. Everywhere you click, the web in 2019 is corporate, and while this isn't a bad thing in some respects, there is something profoundly boring about it.</p>\n<p>I created my new blog site with a feeling of nostalgia for what the web used to be — a wild frontier for freedom in ideas, and a diverse, grungy gathering place for weirdos, hucksters, and scholars. A place where you could let your mind escape your unremarkable physical surroundings to aimlessly wander the world.  </p>\n<p>I wanted to keep a sparseness evocative of the old web for my site design. In the past, sites were plain due to bandwidth and technological constraints, but today we can take a look back and appreciate the focus on content brought by this simplicity. The design is somewhat inspired by <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/\">Salon.com</a>, which I think is one of the most distinctive looking news sites. Salon, of course, was web-only from its inception, and it has this look that is totally self-confident about being a web publication, which I love. Websites that put on a posh air and in doing so nakedly crave the prestige of print publications are deserving of scorn. I feel like Medium was the initiator of this trend although I can't be sure. The worst offender in recent memory is <a href=\"https://quillette.com/\">Quillete.com</a>, which is basically a parody of this phenomenon. The font choice hugely influences the impression given off by a website. Sans-serif is the look of the populist web. I chose Roboto as my main text font, mainly because I like how it looks on Salon. It gives a good, slightly unusual look to long text.   </p>\n<p>As for the technology, I am using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a> to generate a static site. It was interesting to learn about Gatsby, which is extremely cool and trendy right now, but the idea of having a static site with no backend is rather old school. Gatsby makes updating a static site with new content as quick as using a WordPress-like CMS. The advantage of a static site is that I can host it for free on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> (thanks, GitHub!), it's very quick to load, and seems safer in terms of security. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this setup for someone without web development experience, as Gatsby in particular had a pretty steep learning curve. Something like WordPress probably remains the easiest way to spin up a personal blog.</p>\n<p>I've made many failed attempts in the past to get myself to write regularly, but I'm hoping I have learned from my past experiences, and being a liberal, I believe that my nature can be overcome through structure. My downfall in the past has been that I would plan large blog posts about complicated topics, and then never feel inclined to finish them. On my new blog, I hope to write relatively short posts about simple topics like movies I watch, or books I read, and to do so frequently. I would like my main reason for blogging to be to improve my writing, so I'm not too concerned if no one ends up reading what I write here, although feedback is always nice and appreciated. Writing for web needs to be percussive and lively, and I know that I have a problem with having an overly heavy style. For this site I want to work on writing in a terse, clean voice, and clean up some of the sloppy habits that I have developed. I do want to stick to general interest topics and avoid the deluge of rambling personal anecdotes that are an unfortunate hallmark of the blogosphere (a tweet I saw recently about how looking up a recipe for soup online obliges you to read someone's life story before you can learn how to make the soup comes to mind). I want to make a real effort to get good quality writing out there, but I'll try not to take myself too seriously in the process. </p>","excerpt":"The blogosphere has been in a rather sad state as of late.

Theranos was a medical startup that promised to make veinous blood draws obsolete by running a variety of blood tests via a prick of the finger. The company had ambitions to place a Theranos device in every home in America. People would be able to prick their finger and place a drop of blood in their Theranos device, and receive their blood test results right away, all within the confines of their living room.  </p>\n<p>However, Theranos never even came close to solving the engineering challenges required to make this dream a reality. This is a predictable conclusion in retrospect. Theranos's core idea of making blood testing devices use less blood is fairly obvious and must have occurred to the established multinational medical device manufacturers as well - why would the upstart Theranos succeed where they had failed?  </p>\n<p>Theranos didn't let reality stand in the way of its march towards success. Theranos promised capabilities it did not have to enter partnerships with large chains such as Safeway and Walgreens to place Theranos testing centers in their retail locations. Engineers working at Theranos who were bullied into working late nights and weekends did make some progress, but the product they created was nothing more than a prototype, and often gave wildly inaccurate results for many blood tests. Rather than hit the brakes at this point as any responsible company would, Theranos decided to proceed with testing real patients' blood with cavalier disregard for their health and safety.  </p>\n<p>Theranos's trajectory was tightly bound with the personality of its founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes. Bad Blood is as much about Holmes the person as it is about Theranos the company. Holmes dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos. She deftly leveraged family and Stanford connections to open doors for Theranos and assemble a star-studded board of directors (among them Henry Kissinger and James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis). The media couldn't resist Holmes's story of a college dropout upending a staid industry, and a young woman succeeding in the male-dominated startup world. Many observers linked Holmes's larger than life personality with her memorable physical traits such as her deep voice and her hypnotically large eyes (incidentally, one of the sources interviewed in Bad Blood claims Holmes's deep voice is fake and deliberately cultivated). Also interesting is the role of Sunny Balwani, a Theranos executive who was feared by employees and was romantically involved with Holmes, unknown to the board. Any Theranos employees who expressed misgivings about the company's morally questionable actions faced Balwani's wrath. Theranos's celebrity backers made the company appear to be manifestly legitimate, while Holmes and Balwani carried out what was essentially a scam, gobbling up investor funds and corporate contracts while producing nothing but misleading promises and bogus test results.  </p>\n<p>Carreyrou sticks to the facts in his meticulous and no-nonsense telling of the Theranos story, which leaves the reader with more questions than answers. Theranos could not have gotten as far as it did without the support of its famous advocates, its large corporate partners, and fawning media coverage. How is it possible that all of these respectable people were taken in by Holmes and Balwani's chicanery? How could Holmes be clever enough to gain and betray the trust of America's most prominent public figures while at the same time carrying on a charade that was not only a danger to patients but was also clearly unsustainable? Carreyrou doesn't presume to know the answer to these questions. The reader is simply left with a sense of incredulity.   </p>\n<p>Theranos began to unravel after Carreyrou published a long form exposé in the Wall Street Journal. The latter part of Bad Blood deals with Carreyrou's battle with Theranos's desparate attempts to kill the story. This part of the book especially is a page-turner. Seeing the fraud of Theranos unmasked in the end is a triumph for justice in this quintessentially American saga. </p>","excerpt":"Bad Blood is the story of the rise and fall of Theranos.
