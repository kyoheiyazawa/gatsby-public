Determining who invented the hamburger is like trying to find the one cow that provided the ground beef for your hamburger patty. A herd of enterprising immigrants to America all claim to have made the very first hamburger in the late 1800s. And the rest is history. The hamburger has a simple basic form, which leaves plenty of room for customization to make it unique, gourmet, or just plain weird. It's a lowbrow food that transcends class boundaries and has taken over the world. Hamburgers are also quite unhealthy. Like its birthplace of America, the hamburger can be problematic, but in its best manifestations it is egalitarian and free.</p>\n<p>I don't really cook hamburgers because I find them to be too smoky to make in my small apartment, but I do eat a fair number of burgers that other people have made. I have a beef with many hamburgers, which is that the patty is too thick. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think beef by itself doesn't really have an interesting taste and is sort of bland (I have never really liked steaks for this same reason). I appreciate the beef patty in a hamburger when it moderates but also gives heft to the other, stronger flavors in a hamburger, and I also appreciate the smoky crust formed by the so-called Maillard reaction. My cooking hero J. Kenji López-Alt has an informative <a href=\"https://aht.seriouseats.com/2012/09/the-burger-lab-smashed-burgers-vs-smashing-burgers.html\">blog post on the benefits of the burger-smashing technique in developing this crust on the patty.</a></p>\n<p>I recently had a Five Guys burger for the first time. I requested a single patty burger but received a double patty all the same. In my opinion, this was a very unbalanced burger that contained far too much beef. To make matters worse, apparently <a href=\"https://www.mashed.com/60752/make-perfect-five-guys-burger/\">Five Guys does not add salt to their meat as a matter of policy.</a> As a result, the burger had an aggressively bland and dry flavor, which made me sad (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenjilopezalt/status/1145049158245470209\">and I am joined by some prominent voices in disliking Five Guys!</a>)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, one of the best places in the world to get a hamburger is Paris—the capital of anti-American snobbery. The city is full of small, casual burger joints serving quality burgers. Unfortunately, many of them close after lunch and don't reopen until around 7 p.m. When I found myself in Paris wanting a burger in the afternoon, I could only find one nearby place that was open out of perhaps a half-dozen. I remember the burger I had there was quite tasty, but today I searched for the place on Google Maps and I couldn't find it. Perhaps it went bankrupt due to being open in the afternoon. If you are ever in Paris, be sure to eat at a Parisian hamburger joint.</p>\n<p>Closer to home, I think that Shake Shack and Smashburger are solid places to grab a burger. There are undoubtedly other, more gourmet places that serve burgers, but burgers lose some of their appeal for me when they become serious sit-down affairs. I think that burgers are most true to their essence when they are quick, easy, and manageable, and I find that Shake Shack and Smashburger best fulfill this ideal. They both serve fairly small burgers, and I appreciate that I don't feel horribly weighed down by their burgers after eating them. I would say that Shake Shack burgers are more disciplined and balanced, while Smashburger is more wacky in their flavors and presentation. In Minnesota, both of these chains are only located in the suburbs for some reason. I would love to see Shake Shack and Smashburger expand to more urban locations in Minnesota. </p>\n<p>MyBurger is a Twin Cities local burger chain with quite a few urban locations. I work right next to one so I go there relatively often. I am curious to know if they are affiliated in any way with MyPillow, another local business empire. Luckily, MyBurger does not print their CEO's likeness everywhere that they can, <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2019/03/04/report-of-deranged-person-hugging-pillow-in-snow.html\">unlike MyPillow</a>. While MyBurger serves perfectly acceptable burgers, in my opinion they are a little too clean and Teutonic in character. The best hamburgers are messy and dripping with juices—and biting into them almost feels transgressive. </p>","excerpt":"I know of no food that is more essentially American than the hamburger.

Instead, I took to YouTube to watch my favorite travel show, <em>Heads and Tails</em>. <em>Heads and Tails</em> (Орёл и Решка) is a Russian-language TV show produced by a Ukrainian company. I found this show while looking for fun ways to study Russian. Luckily for us Americans who can't watch this show on broadcast TV, the production company of <em>Heads and Tails</em> posts full episodes of the show on YouTube. It's unclear to me how this show is profitable when it is available for free online, especially considering its expensive production format.</p>\n<p>Each episode of <em>Heads and Tails</em> is presented by two hosts, and begins at the airport. The London episode shows the two hosts who have just arrived at Heathrow Airport and are ready to start their weekend vacation in London. One of them is wearing a backpack, and the other is holding the <em>Heads and Tails</em> golden credit card. One of the hosts greets their new destination with a \"<em>Privet</em>, London!\" and flicks a £1 coin into the air. The coin toss decides which of the hosts gets the golden card for the weekend, while the other host is left with the backpack. The host with the golden credit card can spend an unlimited amount of money with the card, while the other host must backpack through the weekend, living off a single $100 bill. After much rejoicing from the bearer of the golden card and grumbling from the backpacker, the two hosts part ways. The backpacker gets gouged by the airport money changer to exchange their $100 for local currency, and then heads to the city on public transit, while the golden host gets picked up at the airport in an ostentacious sports car, ready to live like a millonaire for the weekend. At the end of each episode, the hosts prepare a bottle with $100 tucked inside and hide it in a secluded location, and show you directions on how to find the treasure.  </p>\n<p>This is a super fun format for a travel show, and I'm surprised something similar doesn't exist on English language TV. Having been the backpacker with the $100 bill myself, I am impressed with how accurately <em>Heads and Tails</em> captures the unpredictable nature of budget travel within a slickly produced TV show, and while I'm sure various preparations are happening off camera, the show feels very real and authentic to me. In some locations, $100 is actually a substantial amount of money in relation to the average local wage, and the host can live quite comfortably for the weekend. In some expensive cities, living on $100 is a real challenge, but even in those situations the hosts always do a great job of showcasing fun free things to do in a city. On the other hand, the host with the golden card can show a side of a destination that most of us will never get to experience, which is fun in its own way. Around the megacities of the world, the golden card provides access to jaw dropping hotel rooms and deluxe gastronomic experiences involving very small portions of food. In less touristic destinations, the host with the golden card tends to splash out for experiences that seem more outrageous than luxurious.</p>\n<p>Each season revolves around a particular theme. My favorite was Season 7's \"Back in the USSR,\" in which my favorite <em>Heads and Tails</em> hosts, Andrey Bednyakov and Nastya Korotkaya, visit fascinating locations around the former Soviet Union, from the dapper Baltic states, to places off the tourist radar in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Russian Far East, to sprawling Moscow, where they finish the season.</p>\n<p>Many episodes leave me  wondering which host enjoyed themselves more—the backpacker or the golden card holder. Many doors are opened by money, but money might cause you to overlook some experiences too. Most of my travel experiences have been of the budget variety, and while this led to many fond memories, I also didn't have the option of traveling any other way, so I'm always curious to see what happens when a <em>Heads and Tails</em> host splashes out for a luxurious travel experience. Your financial situation really colors your experience of a place, and this is true whether you live somewhere or are just passing through. <em>Heads and Tails</em> is a strange examination of the hugeness of human life—at each place they travel to they find unique customs, languages, cuisines, and architecture, with the rich and poor going about their mostly separate lives.</p>","excerpt":"When I was planning a trip to London and Paris last year, I didn't turn to Rick Steves or Lonely Planet for guidance.

The discourse around the movie has generally been negative, so I went in with low expectations, but I surprised myself by having a great time! Justice Smith plays the charming main character Tim, a mild mannered insurance adjuster with a repressed love of Pokémon who goes on an adventure to find his dad. Through <em>Rashomon</em>-like twists and turns, Tim must wade through conflicting accounts of a car crash that is tied to his dad's disappearance. This was an exciting storyline with a lot of heart, and it's nice that Tim searches for his dad given that the original Pokémon Game Boy games have you start your adventure by leaving your mom.</p>\n<p>Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu is the more controversial aspect of this movie, although I think for most people the choice of Ryan Reynolds is less outrageous than the fact that Pikachu talks at all. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/broderick/status/930126330615730182\">viral clip of Pikachu briefly speaking English</a> in <em>Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!</em> is still a fresh trauma. Although I was laughing along with the rest of the internet when the <em>Detective Pikachu</em> trailers first came out, after having seen the movie I think that Ryan Reynolds did a good job playing Pikachu in a goofy but sincere way. The other potentially weird thing about this movie is that it has CGI Pokémon that are seamlessly integrated into live action. It was initially shocking to see Pikachu covered in realistic yellow fur in the <em>Detective Pikachu</em> trailer. There is something unsettling about encountering a beloved cartoon character in the flesh. (Artist <a href=\"https://miguel_vasquez.artstation.com/\">Miguel Vazquez</a> has played with this idea by creating some terrifying realistic renditions of characters from <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Hey Arnold</em>, and other cartoons.) So the creators of <em>Detective Pikachu</em> had to strike a fine balance of not making the Pokémon look <em>too</em> realistic, while also not making them look video gamey and fake. I think they mostly got it right, with a few exceptions (among them a scary looking Charizard with weirdly textured skin). The visuals throughout the movie are gorgeous. Ryme City, the setting of the movie, is futuristic and colorful as a Pokémon city should be, but it also feels like a place where real people live and work. It was believable and really cool to see Pokémon inhabiting a live action world just as if they were normal animals. Throughout the movie, Tim wears a leather jacket—but did the leather come from a dead cow or a Tauros? These and other \"are Pokémon animals\" questions sadly remain unanswered in <em>Detective Pikachu</em>. </p>\n<p>In 1996, <em>Pocket Monster Red</em> and <em>Pocket Monster Green</em> were released in Japan for the Nintendo Game Boy. In the following few years, Pokémon became a trading card game, then a TV show, then a worldwide cultural phenomenon. It occurs to me that I am part of a unique generation of people that entered childhood just as Pokémon was coming into existence. When I was growing up, Pokémon was described as a \"craze,\" I think with the expectation that it would soon self-combust and fade away, just like a sugar rush. Today, 23 years later, Pokémon's earliest fans such as myself aren't so young anymore, but Pokémon is still new and exciting—not just confined to the 90s nostalgia bin. Pokémon has had incredible cultural staying power over the years, perhaps only exceeded by that of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. In recent years, Pokémon has birthed the versatile \"Surprised Pikachu\" meme, ruined smartphone batteries around the world with <em>Pokémon Go</em>, and even served as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o95KxKKrgkQ\">poetic inspiration for a Republican Presidential candidate</a>. On another note, I actually ended up seeing <em>Detective Pikachu</em> a second time with a group spanning ages 8 to 28, and we all had a blast, which I think speaks to the incredible power of Pokémon to speak to kids, or the former kids within us. The movie made me want to dig out my old Game Boy and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> cartridge, but I also can't wait to see what new Pokémon thing comes out next.</p>","excerpt":"I recently saw  Pokémon Detective Pikachu  in theaters.

Almost everyone can agree that college has become unreasonably expensive, but the agreement ends there. Some see students as victims who are getting robbed by extortionate tuition, while others feel that students going into debt for degrees with poor employment prospects are dupes who have only themselves to blame. Underlying all of this is a profound confusion about the ultimate function of higher education.</p>\n<p>A basic way to understand college is as a place where a student can gain skills needed to work in certain kinds of jobs. As long as the lifetime wage premium for jobs requiring a college education exceeds the cost to attend a college, going to college makes economic sense, even if it means graduating with debt. It still seems prudent for society as a whole to encourage people to gain these specialized work skills by subsidizing the upfront cost of college, as would be the case under Warren's plan.</p>\n<p>However, when I was studying for my bachelor's degree at Carleton College, I and many other students were studying in academic fields in the humanities and social sciences that seemed to explicitly eschew teaching knowledge that could apply to a particular job. This happens at liberal arts colleges as well as schools of Arts and Sciences at public universities around the country. </p>\n<p>Is there a purpose to college for humanities and social science majors? Many people would say no. However, defenders of the liberal arts claim that a liberal arts education develops thinking and communication skills that are useful in a wide variety of jobs. While this argument is broadly true, it also seems backwards. If studying the humanities imparts those valuable work skills, that is clearly just a desirable side effect rather than the main aim. Surely there are more direct and efficient ways to teach students logic, reading, and writing for a workplace setting than to have them write papers on Aristotle's views on friendship. The liberal arts are only worth studying if the knowledge gained is valuable in itself. </p>\n<p>I believe that the study of the liberal arts is beneficial. I believe the goal of this study should be for a student to develop a sense of history and culture, which can happen through close study of the classics, art history, literature, philosophy, and modern social research. The focus should be on understanding how we got to where we are today, which means understanding the history of ideas in the Western world that created our liberal democratic society. This is the kind of education that can give people a moderate political temperament, as well as the confidence to earnestly and tenatiously defend our liberal freedoms and advocate for effective ways to improve our society. As such, I see the liberal arts as primarily having a political goal of supporting stable democracy. (These are ideas I take mainly from Allan Bloom's famous work, <em>The Closing of the American Mind</em>, which I recommend that everyone read.)</p>\n<p>The trouble, of course, is that while these political benefits help society, they don't materially benefit an individual, so why would someone pay $50,000 a year to receive a liberal arts education? I believe public higher education in all its forms should be provided at a much lower cost, and that if we don't, then liberal arts education may wither away, with worrisome political implications. However, the reality is that the liberal arts live on, for now, because it is interesting enough to study for a certain kind of unfocused, intellectual young person, who very often doesn't have to worry too much about the cost of college due to their financial circumstances. Then, as a little economic bonus for these liberal arts majors, our society's white collar job market discriminates in favor of people with a bachelor's degree, not because the jobs require a particular skill that is taught in college (they generally don't), but because the people doing the hiring are usually college graduates who have every interest in believing that a college degree prepares someone to do a job that should really be open to all regardless of education. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2014/11/20/surprise-humanities-degrees-provide-great-return-on-investment/#517752252031\">The data seems to show that the financial benefit from this favoritism is on average greater than the cost of college tuition</a>, so a liberal arts degree still makes financial sense for most people. And this is what maintains the rather unsatisfying status quo for college today.</p>\n<p>Because colleges seem to be confused as to the point of their existence, they are totally confused on the question of who should get admitted to college. In most countries, universities with selective admissions admit  solely based on test scores. These universities understand their purpose to be to produce the best scholars, and therefore admit those whom they (accurately or not) determine to be the most academically able students. American colleges and universities seem reluctant to relinquish their power to shape the student body to a standardized test. The consideration of a student's character in admission has its origins in a successful <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/10/10/getting-in\">1920s effort by the Ivy League to exclude Jews</a>, who were academically outperforming Protestant students to an unacceptable extent. Recently, Harvard University has been accused of using largely the same system to exclude Asian applicants. Elite colleges everywhere claim that they aim not to admit the most academically talented students, but to create a \"balanced class\" with a diversity of perspectives. I can't help but note that my class at Carleton College would have had a far greater diversity of perspectives had they not chosen to admit primarily students with high test scores and grades. So clearly, it is admitting the most academically qualified students, and not ensuring a diversity of perspectives, that is the main admissions goal for colleges, but they build themselves a lot of wiggle room for other priorities. </p>\n<p>It seems that there is a legitimate debate to be had about athletic and race-based admissions. However, can we all at least agree that preferencial admission for legacies and relations of donors is corrupt and wrong? At Harvard, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/11/04/663629750/legacy-admissions-offer-an-advantage-and-not-just-at-schools-like-harvard\">legacy students enjoyed a 34 percent acceptance rate compared to 5.9 percent for non-legacies</a>. A large donation to a college can \"buy\" a college admission. This is not some weird conspiracy theory—President Rosenberg of Macalester College confirms that <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Only-Surprise-in-the/245882\">\"Virtually everyone who works in the world of college admissions or fund raising knows this to be true.\"</a> Let's call out this practice for what it is: a de facto preference for wealthy white students. This is extremely off-putting and makes a mockery of the egalitarian image that these colleges like to project in their admissions brochures. Some may argue that these preferences secure the funds necessary for colleges to educate less fortunate students. I find this argument unconvincing. Yes, we know that the practice benefits colleges financially—they wouldn't bother with it otherwise. A college's mission is not so noble that it justifies corruption. Furthermore, MIT manages to be both extremely wealthy while officially eschewing legacy preferences (their stance on admissions for the relations of large donors is unclear). Recently, I have been getting many communications from Carleton asking me to make a donation. During my time at Carleton, I received heavy tuition assistance, and I know that my education cost more to provide than what my family and I paid to receive it (as it did for all students, even those paying full tuition). I also recognize that in our country, colleges act both as ladders to opportunity as well as gatekeepers from it, and given this, I find legacy preferences in admissions to be absolutely un-American, so I don't feel inclined to give financial support to any college with such a preference, even to a college I personally benefited from. <a href=\"https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/ira/assets/Carleton_CDS_2018_2019_Final_Copy.pdf\">Carleton lists alumni/ae relation as being an \"Important\" factor in admission</a>. If Carleton feels that they need a legacy preference to keep their big alumni donors happy, then they should raise their money from them, not from a small fry like me. </p>","excerpt":"Elizabeth Warren's proposed plan  to cancel student loan debt and eliminate tuition at public universities has pushed higher education back into the national conversation.
