I am neither well-read nor smart enough to persuasively argue this point, but the fact remains that I can hardly find any American fiction from the 21st century that I can say really transformed my inner life, which is the promise of great writing. There is a tremendous variety of professionally written fiction out there and yet it all seems to lack that soulfulness that is impossible to fake and makes a work truly worth reading.</p>\n<p>By the way, I am not some sort of America hater. It is clear to me that the best movies and TV shows in the world are currently made in America. And we have no shortage of great writers here. American non-fiction writing is amazing and is probably among the world's most credible and compelling. But for some reason this is not the case for novels. Perhaps the form of the novel never really suited the practical American character anyways. We Americans have little patience for idling flâneurs—our proudest achievements are our plumbing and bridges, as Marcel Duchamp pointed out. And here is perhaps a part of what bothers me about the modern American novel: I often get the feeling that the American novel is mainly a practical endeavor for the novelist, an exercise in increasing the writer's personal wealth and status (at least Fitzgerald had the decency to admit this motivation when he wrote <em>This Side of Paradise</em>!) Perhaps as a result of this, I feel that American novelists have too much of a desire to impress, as well as a great fear of causing offense to the left-leaning arbiters of literary taste. They are too beholden to what Tocqueville identified as America's dictator: public opinion. All this is cause for pessimism when browsing the fiction section in the bookstore.</p>\n<p>I much prefer to read fiction from outside America. The books that are sort of my ideals of what a novel should be capable of come from Russia. Reading <em>Generation P</em> by Victor Pelevin forever changed my relationship to the written word and society. And apparently Pelevin and I share the experience of opening up <em>Master and Margarita</em> by Mikhail Bulgakov for the first time, and being blown away to another world from which we would never return.</p>\n<p>It is from this background that I started reading <em>The Idiot</em> by Elif Batuman with high expectations. I figured that an American scholar of Russian literature might be just the right person to write a truly great modern American novel. Predictably, <em>The Idiot</em> did not live up to these unrealistic expectations I had. I thought it was a solidly above-average book, but it's not a book that impacted me in a significant way and I will probably forget about it before too long. I did read Batuman's non-fiction memoir <em>The Possessed</em> before reading <em>The Idiot</em>, which had the effect of revealing to me that many of the happenings in <em>The Idiot</em> are lifted straight from Batuman's actual life. Many of these anecdotes, which are hilarious when recounted in <em>The Possessed</em>, lose much of their meaning when spliced into <em>The Idiot</em>. I hope for a novel to be something more than a collection of random happenings, although too much structure can suffocate a work too. For me, <em>The Idiot</em> was generally too disjointed and mundane to leave much of an impression on me.</p>\n<p>True to her nationality however, Batuman is a fabulous non-fiction writer. Her essay <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v32/n18/elif-batuman/get-a-real-degree\">\"Get a Real Degree\"</a> in London Review of Books gave voice to many of the murky feelings I have about American fiction that I was unable to articulate myself. It is a great pleasure to read through her erudite slaying of literary mandarins. Here is a passage that I found myself silently applauding:  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The continual production of ‘more excellent fiction … than anyone has time to read’ is the essence of the problem. That’s the torture of walking into a bookshop these days: it’s not that you think the books will all be terrible; it’s that you know they’ll all have a certain degree of competent workmanship, that most will have about three genuinely beautiful or interesting sentences and no really bad ones, that many will have at least one convincing, well-observed character, and that nearly all will be bound up in a story that you can’t bring yourself to care about. All that great writing, trapped in mediocre books! Who, indeed, has time to read them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A novel called <em>The Exception</em> by Danish writer Christian Jungersen is briefly mentioned in this article. I decided to read it, and it ended up being one of the best fiction books I have read in a long time. I had been feeling sort of burnt out by fiction and had been reading mainly non-fiction for a while, but reading <em>The Exception</em> totally restored my faith in the power of fiction. This is an ambitious book that operates on a few different levels, and I think mostly succeeds on all of them. The story is told from the perspective of four women who work together at the office of the Danish Centre for Genocide Information. First, it is an intensely detailed psychological look their interactions, slights both imagined and real, insecurities, and secrets. Additionally, the book has an overarching question of whether outbreaks of mass violence have their origins in human nature, and if those dark impulses can be found even in the developed West, among educated, well-meaning people working in a quiet office at the Center for Genocide Information. Lastly, <em>The Exception</em> is simply great entertainment. It is a heart-pounding thriller that had me glued to its pages until the very end. This reason alone is enough to say that <em>The Exception</em> is successful as a novel, but its fearless examination of larger, profound themes makes this book truly outstanding. I highly recommend that everyone read it. </p>","excerpt":"There is something seriously wrong with modern American fiction.

Determining who invented the hamburger is like trying to find the one cow that provided the ground beef for your hamburger patty. A herd of enterprising immigrants to America all claim to have made the very first hamburger in the late 1800s. And the rest is history. The hamburger has a simple basic form, which leaves plenty of room for customization to make it unique, gourmet, or just plain weird. It's a lowbrow food that transcends class boundaries and has taken over the world. Hamburgers are also quite unhealthy. Like its birthplace of America, the hamburger can be problematic, but in its best manifestations it is egalitarian and free.</p>\n<p>I don't really cook hamburgers because I find them to be too smoky to make in my small apartment, but I do eat a fair number of burgers that other people have made. I have a beef with many hamburgers, which is that the patty is too thick. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I think beef by itself doesn't really have an interesting taste and is sort of bland (I have never really liked steaks for this same reason). I appreciate the beef patty in a hamburger when it moderates but also gives heft to the other, stronger flavors in a hamburger, and I also appreciate the smoky crust formed by the so-called Maillard reaction. My cooking hero J. Kenji López-Alt has an informative <a href=\"https://aht.seriouseats.com/2012/09/the-burger-lab-smashed-burgers-vs-smashing-burgers.html\">blog post on the benefits of the burger-smashing technique in developing this crust on the patty.</a></p>\n<p>I recently had a Five Guys burger for the first time. I requested a single patty burger but received a double patty all the same. In my opinion, this was a very unbalanced burger that contained far too much beef. To make matters worse, apparently <a href=\"https://www.mashed.com/60752/make-perfect-five-guys-burger/\">Five Guys does not add salt to their meat as a matter of policy.</a> As a result, the burger had an aggressively bland and dry flavor, which made me sad (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kenjilopezalt/status/1145049158245470209\">and I am joined by some prominent voices in disliking Five Guys!</a>)</p>\n<p>Interestingly, one of the best places in the world to get a hamburger is Paris—the capital of anti-American snobbery. The city is full of small, casual burger joints serving quality burgers. Unfortunately, many of them close after lunch and don't reopen until around 7 p.m. When I found myself in Paris wanting a burger in the afternoon, I could only find one nearby place that was open out of perhaps a half-dozen. I remember the burger I had there was quite tasty, but today I searched for the place on Google Maps and I couldn't find it. Perhaps it went bankrupt due to being open in the afternoon. If you are ever in Paris, be sure to eat at a Parisian hamburger joint.</p>\n<p>Closer to home, I think that Shake Shack and Smashburger are solid places to grab a burger. There are undoubtedly other, more gourmet places that serve burgers, but burgers lose some of their appeal for me when they become serious sit-down affairs. I think that burgers are most true to their essence when they are quick, easy, and manageable, and I find that Shake Shack and Smashburger best fulfill this ideal. They both serve fairly small burgers, and I appreciate that I don't feel horribly weighed down by their burgers after eating them. I would say that Shake Shack burgers are more disciplined and balanced, while Smashburger is more wacky in their flavors and presentation. In Minnesota, both of these chains are only located in the suburbs for some reason. I would love to see Shake Shack and Smashburger expand to more urban locations in Minnesota. </p>\n<p>MyBurger is a Twin Cities local burger chain with quite a few urban locations. I work right next to one so I go there relatively often. I am curious to know if they are affiliated in any way with MyPillow, another local business empire. Luckily, MyBurger does not print their CEO's likeness everywhere that they can, <a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2019/03/04/report-of-deranged-person-hugging-pillow-in-snow.html\">unlike MyPillow</a>. While MyBurger serves perfectly acceptable burgers, in my opinion they are a little too clean and Teutonic in character. The best hamburgers are messy and dripping with juices—and biting into them almost feels transgressive. </p>","excerpt":"I know of no food that is more essentially American than the hamburger.

Instead, I took to YouTube to watch my favorite travel show, <em>Heads and Tails</em>. <em>Heads and Tails</em> (Орёл и Решка) is a Russian-language TV show produced by a Ukrainian company. I found this show while looking for fun ways to study Russian. Luckily for us Americans who can't watch this show on broadcast TV, the production company of <em>Heads and Tails</em> posts full episodes of the show on YouTube. It's unclear to me how this show is profitable when it is available for free online, especially considering its expensive production format.</p>\n<p>Each episode of <em>Heads and Tails</em> is presented by two hosts, and begins at the airport. The London episode shows the two hosts who have just arrived at Heathrow Airport and are ready to start their weekend vacation in London. One of them is wearing a backpack, and the other is holding the <em>Heads and Tails</em> golden credit card. One of the hosts greets their new destination with a \"<em>Privet</em>, London!\" and flicks a £1 coin into the air. The coin toss decides which of the hosts gets the golden card for the weekend, while the other host is left with the backpack. The host with the golden credit card can spend an unlimited amount of money with the card, while the other host must backpack through the weekend, living off a single $100 bill. After much rejoicing from the bearer of the golden card and grumbling from the backpacker, the two hosts part ways. The backpacker gets gouged by the airport money changer to exchange their $100 for local currency, and then heads to the city on public transit, while the golden host gets picked up at the airport in an ostentacious sports car, ready to live like a millonaire for the weekend. At the end of each episode, the hosts prepare a bottle with $100 tucked inside and hide it in a secluded location, and show you directions on how to find the treasure.  </p>\n<p>This is a super fun format for a travel show, and I'm surprised something similar doesn't exist on English language TV. Having been the backpacker with the $100 bill myself, I am impressed with how accurately <em>Heads and Tails</em> captures the unpredictable nature of budget travel within a slickly produced TV show, and while I'm sure various preparations are happening off camera, the show feels very real and authentic to me. In some locations, $100 is actually a substantial amount of money in relation to the average local wage, and the host can live quite comfortably for the weekend. In some expensive cities, living on $100 is a real challenge, but even in those situations the hosts always do a great job of showcasing fun free things to do in a city. On the other hand, the host with the golden card can show a side of a destination that most of us will never get to experience, which is fun in its own way. Around the megacities of the world, the golden card provides access to jaw dropping hotel rooms and deluxe gastronomic experiences involving very small portions of food. In less touristic destinations, the host with the golden card tends to splash out for experiences that seem more outrageous than luxurious.</p>\n<p>Each season revolves around a particular theme. My favorite was Season 7's \"Back in the USSR,\" in which my favorite <em>Heads and Tails</em> hosts, Andrey Bednyakov and Nastya Korotkaya, visit fascinating locations around the former Soviet Union, from the dapper Baltic states, to places off the tourist radar in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Russian Far East, to sprawling Moscow, where they finish the season.</p>\n<p>Many episodes leave me  wondering which host enjoyed themselves more—the backpacker or the golden card holder. Many doors are opened by money, but money might cause you to overlook some experiences too. Most of my travel experiences have been of the budget variety, and while this led to many fond memories, I also didn't have the option of traveling any other way, so I'm always curious to see what happens when a <em>Heads and Tails</em> host splashes out for a luxurious travel experience. Your financial situation really colors your experience of a place, and this is true whether you live somewhere or are just passing through. <em>Heads and Tails</em> is a strange examination of the hugeness of human life—at each place they travel to they find unique customs, languages, cuisines, and architecture, with the rich and poor going about their mostly separate lives.</p>","excerpt":"When I was planning a trip to London and Paris last year, I didn't turn to Rick Steves or Lonely Planet for guidance.
