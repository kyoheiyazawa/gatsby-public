{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1>about</h1>\n<p>This site is a blog where I will blog about stuff, and it's also a place for me to experiment with web technologies. The site was created using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">GatsbyJS</a>. GatsbyJS is a nice way to make a static site with React components, and I'm using a plugin that lets me write my content in markdown files. It's hosted on <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a>, for free! Thanks, GitHub Pages.  </p>"}},"pageContext":{}}
