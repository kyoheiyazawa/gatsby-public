{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p><em>American Idiot</em> is Green Day's seventh studio album. Released in 2004, it delivered chart-smashing success for Green Day against the backdrop of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and its overarching theme — the Iraq War. Though the album is full of strong singles such as \"Holiday\" and \"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\" the entire album is tied together by a rock opera concept in the same vein as the Who's <em>Tommy</em>. <em>American Idiot</em> tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, a troubled, unremarkable teen from a generic American suburb.  </p>\n<p><em>American Idiot</em> was the hottest shit when it came out while I was in middle school. The black Parental Advisory label on the CD cover prevented some kids from obtaining the CD but made its anti-authoritarianism come across stronger — we all resented Tipper Gore's legacy while wishing her husband were the president instead of the Doonesbury asterisk who sat in the White House. The album is packed full of catchy songs, and I can still play all of the songs from the album on guitar — an easy accomplishment since the entire album is power chords over meat and potatoes sort of progressions. While a lot of good music was produced in this era, <em>American Idiot</em> more than any other album of this time confronted head-on the alienation I and my peers felt at suburban monoculture and American chauvinism close to home, and the criminal acts of an isolated America abroad. I grew up in the environs of Boulder, a blue enclave within red Colorado at the time. I imagine people who grew up elsewhere experienced this era quite differently. Thinking back on it now, I think that the Bush era is when the fraying apart of American society really began in earnest. <em>American Idiot</em> is my generation's definitive soundtrack to this important time period in our lives and American society.  </p>\n<p>Here are my top 3 tracks from <em>American Idiot</em>, ranked.  </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1-YMsOUE2I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>  \n</iframe>  \n    \n### Give Me Novacaine\nsdsfsdfsdf","excerpt":"American Idiot  is Green Day's seventh studio album.
